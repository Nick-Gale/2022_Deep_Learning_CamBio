# Outline of Learning Projects
===============================
I need to learn several neural network architectures. Every week I shall implement at least one in PyTorch.

Architectures/Frameworks:
1. Reccurent Neural Network: Text
2. LSTM: Sound
3. GAN - Reccurent: Sound Generation
4. Convolutional: Image Classification
5. Convoluational: Image Generation
6. Transformer: Genome Sequence Analysis
7. Graph Neural Network: TBD
8. Autoencoder: Simple Encoding Task
9. Variational Autoencoder GAN: Image Generation

The rough outline is:
July: 1, 2, 3
August: 4, 5, 6, 7
September: 8, 9
