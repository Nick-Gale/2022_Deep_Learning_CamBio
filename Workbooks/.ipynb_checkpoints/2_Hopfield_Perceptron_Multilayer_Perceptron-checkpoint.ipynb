    "In the introduction notebook we clarified what precisely we mean by a neural network and some key terms such as *node, neuron, activiation function*. In this notebook we will begin to build more complicated and useful neural networks. The first neural network is a historical landmark example which provided the basis for not only a useful network topology, but also a working mathematical of memory: The Hopfield Network. We will then cover the multilayer perceptron in more detail. The key learning outcomes of this notebook are: understanding how neural networks work in practice; developing a working model of memory; understanding the blueprint model for modern neural networks."
